# Bank-Loan-Report-Data-Analytics-Project

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Bank Loan Report to monitor, analyze, and visualize key lending metrics and portfolio performance. By leveraging Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL, the project delivers interactive dashboards and data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making in banking operations.

Key Highlights:

Data Preparation & Integration:
Cleaned, transformed, and modeled large-scale loan data using SQL and Python (Pandas, NumPy). Performed data validation, handled missing values, standardized formats, and optimized data models for visualization tools.

KPI Analysis:
Monitored and analyzed critical performance indicators, including total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios to evaluate financial stability and lending efficiency.

Good vs. Bad Loan Segmentation:
Classified loans based on repayment status to measure portfolio health and identify risk patterns. This segmentation enabled insights into borrower behavior and default trends for better credit risk management.

Interactive Dashboards:

Summary Dashboard: Displays overall performance metrics, including total loans, approval rates, and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.

Overview Dashboard: Visualizes lending data by region, loan term, purpose, employment length, and home ownership using dynamic charts (line, bar, map, donut, and tree map).

Details Dashboard: Provides an in-depth loan-level view to enhance transparency and support operational analysis.

Tech Stack:
Power BI | Tableau | Python (Pandas, NumPy) | SQL

Outcome:
This project demonstrates strong data analytics, business intelligence, and visual storytelling skills — transforming raw banking data into actionable insights. The solution empowers decision-makers with a holistic view of lending performance, risk exposure, and borrower demographics, ultimately supporting data-driven lending strategies and portfolio optimization.
